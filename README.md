# AWWW Coding Workshop 01

CODING WORKSHOP | October 21st, 2017  

At AWWW group at SAIC, I was requested to do a coding tutorial for fellow design & art students which covers the fundamentals of web development. Hence I developed a curriculum and taught a foundation of web design and web development to fellow SAIC students.

During the workshop, I demonstrated the core concept of HTML, CSS and introduced the fundamentals of web programming languages and structures. Students after the workshop were able to write their own code to build a fully functional website.

Skills taught:
* HTML
* CSS
* Fundamentals of web programming languages, concepts and structures.
